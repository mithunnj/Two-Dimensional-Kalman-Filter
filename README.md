# Two-Dimensional-Kalman-Filter

Used Python to program various probability distributions and concepts including Bayes’ rule to determine a robot’s location in a 1D and 2D world. Understood the concept that entropy (uncertainty) decreases when we receive sensing data from the robot, and entropy increases when a robot moves positions. I was able to develop sensing and movement algorithms that resulted in a more accurate posterior probability distribution of the robot’s position in it’s world.

I applied a multiplicative factor for the measurement updates, and a convolution operation to the motion updates to help localize the robot in its environment.
